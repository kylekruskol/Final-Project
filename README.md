# About Me

My name is Kyle Kruskol and I am a Sophomore at *Mizzou* studying business marketing. Here at *Mizzou* I am involved in **Marketing Club** and **Pi Sigma Epsilon Business Fraternity**. I also work at Campus Bar and Grill here in Columbia.

### Growing Up

<p>Since I was 5 years old I have spent my life in Sycamore, IL. This is where I went to Elementary, Middle, and High School.</p>

Here is a list of the activites I was involved in High School
  * Key Club
  * Baseball
  * Youth Engaged in Philanthropy
  * Working at Restraunt called Portillo's Hot Dogs
  
Here is an image link to a picture of my high school: [Sycamore High School] (https://www.northernpublicradio.org/sites/wnij/files/styles/medium/public/201710/sycamore_high_school.jpg "Sycamore High School")

I worked at Portillo's for 2 years in High school and I got a lot of great experience there. I first started on the register where I learned how to deal with monetary transactions. I then moved around different positions and learned how to cook food, make drinks, and prepare customers orders. I ended up being very experienced there and trained many new employees. I unfortunelty had to quit my job there when I decided to go to school here at the University of Missouri. The food there was very good and people from the midwest will tell you the same. Here is the link to the menu if you are interested:  [Portillos](https://www.portillos.com/all-menus/)
  
My favorite foods to get from the **Portillos** menu are
 - Hot Dog
 - Bacon Cheese Burger
 - Beef Sandwich

Kelsie goes to school at the ***University of Georgia*** and is studying political science. Over the years I have aquired some of my best friends that I hang out with the time. Some of there names are

 - Dylan
 - Zach

I also have a girlfriend named Kallie who I have been in relationship with for 4 years of my life. We started dating in September of 2016. 
 
 ### Music
 
 I have always loved music and it is something I listen to everyday during the activities that I do. My favorite genre is **rap music** but I also enjoy punk pop and R&B soul. Here is a list of my 10 favorite artists:
 1. *Mac Miller*
 2. *Travis Scott*
 3. *The Weeknd*
 4. *Kid Cudi*
 5. *Juice WRLD*
 6. *iann dior*
 7. *Arizona Zervas*
 8. *Lil Skies*
 9. *Post Malone*
 10. *Lil Uzi Vert*
 
 One of my favorite lyric quotes is from Mac Miller, he says:
 
 >No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
 
 I really enjoy that lyric because it helps you think about whatever situation you are in in life, to be happy and smile and to always be positive.
 
 I listen to my music through a streaming service called *Spotify*. Here is the link to it if you are intereseted:[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/)
 
 ### Fitness
 
 Another important part of my life is fitness and working out. Throughout high school I was mostly a chubby kid but once I got to college I decided to change my ways and to get in shape. I started working out everyday running and lifting weights and I was very pleased with my results. I still am very involved in fitness and it has become a lifestyle for me now. 
 
 Micheal John Bobak once said:
 
 >All progress takes place outside of the comfort zone
 
 This quote means that no one wants to work out and sometimes it can be annoying and uncomfortable but it is neccesarry in order to make progress.
